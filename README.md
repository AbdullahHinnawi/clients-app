In the root directory you need to create a file called ".env" in which you
can save database credentials. File content could be as
the following (replace username, password, cluster-name, and database-name with your own):

```sh
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster-name>.6avck.mongodb.net/<database-name>?retryWrites=true&w=majority

PORT=3001
BASE_URI=http://localhost:3001
NODE_ENV=development

TEST_MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster-name>.6avck.mongodb.net/<database-name>?retryWrites=true&w=majority
```

Then run the server using:

```sh
npm run dev
```

You can also run the integration tests using:

```sh
npm run test
```
